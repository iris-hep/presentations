\begin{itemize}
\item The IRIS-HEP goals include continued community engagement 
\item This will build on initial collaborations developed as part of the HSF CWP process
\item Continuity from our S2I2-HEP efforts as part of the CWP, e.g.\ support for CWP/S2I2-HEP-style workshops
\item ``Blueprint'' meetings to build common vision between projects
\item NSF has stepped forward with HL-LHC S\&C R\&D funds through IRIS-HEP
\item As other efforts (hopefully) come forward, we will be looking for ways to build synergistic collaborations through entities like the HSF
\end{itemize}
