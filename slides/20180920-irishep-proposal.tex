\frametitle{Background: Community White Paper and S2I2-HEP}

\begin{itemize}
\item The CWP was clearly a successful community process, which produced a clear roadmap of R\&D in a number of strategic areas. 
\item The process also demonstrated the desire of the community to work togetherand demonstrated the value of the HSF to build these collaborations
\item Building on this, we also submitted a strategic plan to NSF from the S2I2-HEP with a subset of areas where the U.S.\ university community could contribute - \url{http://s2i2-hep.org}
\item Focused not only on cost/resources/technology issues, but also opportunities for increased physics reach and sustainability
\item This led to a proposal this past spring for the ``Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)''
\item IRIS-HEP was funded on 1 Sept, 2018
\end{itemize}
