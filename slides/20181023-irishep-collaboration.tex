\frametitle{IRIS-HEP and HL-LHC R\&D Collaboration}

\begin{itemize}
\item (Mostly internal) IRIS-HEP institute kick-off meeting next week at U.Chicago
\item The IRIS-HEP goals include continued community engagement, we will build on initial collaborations developed as part of the HSF CWP process. Continuity from our S2I2-HEP efforts as part of the CWP, e.g.\ support for CWP/S2I2-HEP-style workshops
\item ``Blueprint'' meetings to build common vision between projects
\item NSF has stepped forward with HL-LHC S\&C R\&D funds through IRIS-HEP. IRIS-HEP will collaborate with other US efforts (US-ATLAS, US-CMS, OSG, etc.)
\item As other efforts (hopefully) come forward, we will be looking for ways to build synergistic collaborations through entities like the HSF, and through direct collaborations with ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, etc.
\end{itemize}
