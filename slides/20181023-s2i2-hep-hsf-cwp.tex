\frametitle{Background: Community White Paper and S2I2-HEP}

\begin{itemize}
\item Like other agencies, the US NSF has recognized the scale of the software and computing challenges of the HL-LHC
\item NSF provided a small ``planning grant'' (S2I2-HEP) in 2016 to understand what R\&D is needed to meet this challenge and how the U.S. university community could contribute
\item {\it Reminder: NSF primarily funds the U.S universities}
\item PIs: Elmer/Princeton/CMS, Neubauer/UIUC/ATLAS, Sokoloff/Cincinnati/LHCb, but with ``participant funds'' to help bring people together to prepare a roadmap
\item However a plan for U.S.\ universities in isolation is less valuable unless part of a more global vision
\item S2I2-HEP allowed us to work with the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) on the Community White Paper (CWP) roadmap process and document 
\end{itemize}
